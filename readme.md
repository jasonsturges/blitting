Blitting
========

## Introduction

Blitting is a rendering engine and lifecycle pipeline for ActionScript, distributed as a SWC library.

Focused in bit blit (bit-boundary block transfer), Blitting leverages performance oriented design
for graphics, bitmap, and 3D rendering.  Through a core engine, pipelines optimize rendering, layout, and invalidation lifecycles.

[Blitting OpenFL](https://github.com/jasonsturges/blitting-openfl) is an [OpenFL](http://www.openfl.org/) port to the
[Haxe](http://haxe.org/) programming language, and is distributed as a haxelib.  Haxe developers should use Blitting OpenFL.
